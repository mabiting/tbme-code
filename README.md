The ‘dualm arm. m’ file is used for modeling and reachable workspace calculation of dual-arm patch clamp system, and the 'python2cpp_thread.py' file is used for communication between PyCharm and Qt. The program locates the micropipette tip of the microscope image sent by Qt, and then sends the micropipette tip coordinates to Qt, achieving the micropipette tip positioning function during patch clamp operation.
